# MusicGen
This project aims to create an AI-driven music generation system using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. By training the model on a dataset of MIDI files, the AI can learn patterns in music and generate new musical compositions.

Planning on a multi layer model in the future and experimenting with different datasets and ideally with more epochs as I am limited by hardware right now
